# Tab Out

**Keep tabs on your tabs.**

Tab Out is a Chrome extension that opens a dashboard of everything you have open. Tabs are grouped by domain, with homepages (Gmail, X, LinkedIn, etc.) pulled into their own group. Close tabs with a satisfying swoosh + confetti.

No server. No account. No external API calls. Just a Chrome extension.

## Install with a coding agent

Send your coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) this repo and say **"install this"**:

```
https://github.com/zarazhangrui/tab-out
```

The agent will walk you through it. Takes about 1 minute.

## Manual Setup

**1. Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zarazhangrui/tab-out.git
```

**2. Load the Chrome extension**

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top-right toggle)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Navigate to the `extension/` folder inside the cloned repo and select it

**3. Open Tab Out**

Click the Tab Out extension icon, or use **Alt+Shift+T**.

Chrome's native new tab page stays untouched by default. To make new tabs open Tab Out, enable it in Settings.

## How it works

```
You click the Tab Out extension icon, press Alt+Shift+T, or enable new-tab replacement in Settings
  -> Tab Out opens its own page and shows your open tabs grouped by domain
  -> Homepages (Gmail, X, etc.) get their own group at the top
  -> Click any tab title to jump to it
  -> Close groups you're done with (swoosh + confetti)
  -> Save tabs for later before closing them
```

Everything runs inside the Chrome extension. No external server, no API calls, no data sent anywhere. Saved tabs are stored in `chrome.storage.local`.
